## Personal Statement {#personal-statement .unnumbered}

Passionate about the intersection of physics and healthcare, I am a
physicist with a strong background in medical physics. My undergraduate
project focused on inverse optimization algorithms in radiotherapy
treatment planning, giving me practical insights into the application of
physics in healthcare. In my postgraduate project, I optimized ASL-MRI
sequences and created an efficient image processing pipeline for
clinicians.

I also have **experience in software development** using `Java` and
`Python`, combining my physics knowledge with programming skills to
create efficient solutions. Additionally, **my recent postgraduate
studies have enhanced my proficiency in machine learning methods and
artificial intelligence applications**, expanding my programming
repertoire and analytic capabilities.

## MRI Physicist {#mri-physicist .unnumbered}

[Mediso Ltd. --- 2 years & 9 months]{.smallcaps}

![image](mediso.jpg){width="\\linewidth"}

As an MRI physicist, I played a key role in the **research and
development of the MRI modality**, collaborating with a team of
engineers and physicists. Specifically, I contributed to the software
development of the nanoScan MRI and PET/MRI lineup. My responsibilities
encompassed sequence development based on user requirements, optimizing
protocols, and conducting sequence testing on the hardware.
Additionally, I participated in projects involving the development and
implementation of post-processing pipelines within the software.
Throughout these endeavours, I utilized and improved my coding skills in
`Java` and `MATLAB`, which further ignited my interest in software
development.

## Medical Engineering & Physics MSc {#medical-engineering-physics-msc .unnumbered}

[KCL --- King's College London]{.smallcaps}

![image](kcl.png){width="\\linewidth"}

The course I pursued was accredited by [IPEM]{.smallcaps}, the Institute
of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. Within this program, I
specialized in the Medical Physics stream, furthering my journey towards
becoming a skilled medical physicist.

For my thesis project, I focused on the application of ASL-MRI in the
early detection of dementia. This research was carried out in
collaboration with the Neuroradiology Department at King's College
Hospital. Throughout this project, I developed a dedicated software
pipeline using `MATLAB` for image processing and visualization.
Additionally, I utilized python tools to enhance the interactive data
visualization aspects.

## Physics BSc {#physics-bsc .unnumbered}

[ELTE --- Eötvös Loránd Research University]{.smallcaps}

![image](elte.jpg){width="\\linewidth"}

During my course of study, I dedicated my focus to theoretical physics
and research. As I progressed into the third semester, I expanded my
knowledge by enrolling in specialized courses in bioengineering and
biophysics. Additionally, I pursued courses in computer science, with a
particular emphasis on utilizing the `C` and `C++` programming languages
for computational physics applications.

My thesis project centered around brachytherapy treatment planning and
optimization, conducted in collaboration with the Radiotherapy
Department at the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology. This
immersive project allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a
practical setting, providing a deeper understanding of the field while
solidifying my passion for medical physics.

## Postgraduate Project {#postgraduate-project .unnumbered}

[Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital]{.smallcaps}\
[March 2019 --- September 2019]{.smallcaps}

![image](kch.jpg){width="\\linewidth"}

The main aim of the project was the development of an optimized and
quantitative ASL-MRI data acquisition and analyses protocol for dementia
patients in the Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital. In
order to achieve this, I developed a `MATLAB` based code, implementing
common tools used in the processing and analyses of images acquired with
the use of ASL-MRI on test subjects. Further tools for image
segmentation were also explored and applied based on pre-existing
atlases. For effective data visualization, an additional python
application was implemented. The project was carried out in the
Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital.

## Undergraduate Project {#undergraduate-project .unnumbered}

[Hungarian National Institute of Oncology]{.smallcaps}\
[November 2017 --- June 2018]{.smallcaps}

![image](noi.jpg){width="\\linewidth"}

In this project conducted at the Hungarian National Institute of
Oncology, my main focus was to compare and retrospectively analyze two
optimization algorithms used in high dose rate brachytherapy treatment.
The project involved working with a well-established dataset of
optimized patient data and utilizing the new algorithm to optimize this
dataset further. To compare the performance of the algorithms, I
conducted a comprehensive statistical evaluation using StatSoft's
STATISTICA 12 software. This immersive project provided a unique
opportunity to delve into the intricacies of radiation therapy
optimization and its impact on patient outcomes.
