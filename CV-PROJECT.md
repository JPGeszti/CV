## Personal Statement {#personal-statement .unnumbered}

I am a physicist with a background in theoretical physics and a passion
for the field of medical physics. During my undergraduate studies, I had
the opportunity to work on a fascinating project focused on inverse
optimization algorithms used in radiotherapy treatment planning. This
experience allowed me to gain practical insights into the application of
physics in healthcare and further sparked my interest in the field. For
my postgraduate project, I worked on ASL-MRI sequence optimization and
automated image processing.

In my previous job placement, I had the opportunity to engage in
software development tasks that required expertise in the Java
programming language. I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of my work, as it
allowed me to combine my physics knowledge with programming skills to
create efficient and effective solutions. Furthermore, my recent
postgraduate studies have equipped me with a strong foundation in Python
development, expanding my repertoire of programming languages.

## MRI Physicist {#mri-physicist .unnumbered}

[Mediso Ltd. --- 2 years & 9 months]{.smallcaps}

In my role as an MRI physicist, I did R&D for the MRI modality with a
team of engineers and physicists. I aided the software development of
the nanoScan MRI and PET/MRI lineup. My responsibilities included
sequence development based on user requirements. I also provided
protocols with the developed imaging sequences for the users, and
gathered experience with protocol optimization and sequence testing on
the hardware. I also worked on projects where post-processing pipelines
were developed and implemented in the software. My main coding languages
were `Java` and `MATLAB` for the given projects.

## Mathematics Expert in Data Analytics and Machine Learning {#mathematics-expert-in-data-analytics-and-machine-learning .unnumbered}

[ELTE --- Eötvös Loránd Research University]{.smallcaps} [Postgraduate
Specialization Program]{.smallcaps}

The focus of the training is machine learning, its techniques and
solutions from the fields of statistics and deep learning, as well as
data science and big data. My thesis will be written on Natural Language
Processing Models.

## Medical Engineering & Physics MSc {#medical-engineering-physics-msc .unnumbered}

[KCL --- King's College London]{.smallcaps}

The course is accredited by [IPEM]{.smallcaps}. I completed the courses
of the **Medical Physics** stream to become a medical physicist. **My
thesis project** was on the application of ASL-MRI in the early
detection of dementia, conducted in the Neuroradiology Department of
King's College Hospital. This project involved the creation of a
dedicated `MATLAB` based software for image processing and visualization
as well as the utilization of python tools for further interactive data
visualization.

## Physics BSc {#physics-bsc .unnumbered}

[ELTE --- Eötvös Loránd Research University]{.smallcaps}

The focus of the course had more emphasis on theoretical physics and
research. From the third semester, I also took specialized courses in
bioengineering and biophysics. I also had courses in computer science,
focusing mainly on `C` and `C++` programming languages and their
applications in computational physics. **My thesis project** was on
brachytherapy treatment planning and optimization, conducted in the
Radiotherapy Department of the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology.

# Academic Experience {#academic-experience .unnumbered}

## Postgraduate Project {#postgraduate-project .unnumbered}

[Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital]{.smallcaps}\
[March 2019 --- September 2019]{.smallcaps}

The main aim of the project was the development of an optimized and
quantitative ASL-MRI data acquisition and analyses protocol for dementia
patients in the Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital. In
order to achieve this, I developed a `MATLAB` based code, implementing
common tools used in the processing and analyses of images acquired with
the use of ASL-MRI on test subjects. Further tools for image
segmentation were also explored and applied based on pre-existing
atlases. For effective data visualization, an additional python
application was implemented. The project was carried out in the
Neuroradiology Department of King's College Hospital.

## Undergraduate Project {#undergraduate-project .unnumbered}

[Hungarian National Institute of Oncology]{.smallcaps}\
[November 2017 --- June 2018]{.smallcaps}

The main aim of the project was the comparison and retrospective
analyses of two optimization algorithms on patients who had undergone
high dose rate brachytherapy treatment. The project involved the
establishment of a set of previously optimized patient data, and the
optimization of these with the new algorithm. This set of patient data
was then statistically evaluated to compare the two algorithms. For this
evaluation, StatSoft's STATISTICA 12 software was used. The project was
carried out in the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology.
